# Prose

Here is where I get to write about nonsense philosophy. If you find any of
these writings beneficial, literally share the word(s)!

My blog will be used for broadcasting updates on my life. This is in contrast
to *serious prose* which will be left for essays.

`(inject '(hr))`

## [Essays](/prose/essay)

Take everything I write about with a bucket of salt. I will come to conclusions
that are likely controversial simply because I tend to follow logical paths
more than common sense.

On the other hand, increased life experience will likely discover gaps,
loopholes, and mistakes in my logic that will debunk many of the conclusions I
write about.

In other words, I will be wrong about many things I write, even if only
temporarily. But these are necessary steps in a journey towards uncovering more
truths. This may come off as untrustworthy and inconsistent, but alas, humans
are mere blobs of flesh that only learn from failures and mistakes. I'd like to
be bold and later found wrong rather than be conservative and state the
obvious.

Here is a list of works I highly recommend:

- *Tao Te Ching*`(sidenote "It can be argued whether the piece is prose, but
  relying on Western standards is subpar.")` (Lao Tzu)
- *Nineteen-Eighty-Four* (George Orwell)
- *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* (Harold Abelson and Gerald
  Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman)
- *Hackers and Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age* ([Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com))
- *The Power of Now* (Eckhart Tolle)
