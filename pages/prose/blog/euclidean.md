## Euclidean Geometry is Underrated

This is the story of how cyclic quadrilaterals, radical axes, and homothety
have gradually taken over my life.

After publishing the initial site, I decided to take a break from code to do
something else for a while. At first I was considering drawing sketches or
solving combinatorics problems, but strangely enough, I found myself picking up
a geometry book I bought some years ago.

If you've read my math page, you'll know that I enjoy discrete math, so it was
quite odd for me to suddenly crave for geometry. Perhaps the appeal was the
pretty diagrams I got to draw with compass and straightedge. I admit, there is
a certain meditative quality in patiently turning words into pictures.

Anyways, I made my way through the book and got acquainted with propositions,
theorems, and lemmas as I worked them out on sheets of paper. Eventually I
started solving some exercises, and soon I was craving to get past the theory
to dive right into the wild west of exhilarating problems.

One fun problem`(sidenote "For those impatiently curious, the solution is on
this site.")` I was immediately confronted with was the following:

`(oly "Canada 1991/3" 0)`

The beauty of Euclidean geometry lies in its simple character. There are no
crazy equations`(sidenote "With the exceptions of rectilinear coordinates,
complex numbers, barycentric coordinates, linear algebra, etc.")`, no confusing
objects, no fancy notation, yet results are often astonishing. It's no wonder
that geometry is called the **king** of mathematics. And strangely, the process
of exploring and solving problems synthetically can often feel close to
discrete math.

Unfortunately, geometry gets a bad rap in conventional education and other
academic institutions. It's often written off as "useless" and "trivial" by
many. In fact, Euclidean geometry is a dead topic among *most* professional
mathematicians despite its historical origins. In a way though, the field is a
hidden gemâ€”detached from the world, only showing itself to those who seek it.

It's often hard as a beginner to recognize the depth to which something simple
manifests. When I tried getting into geometry years ago, the theory seemed too
"fundamental" and the problems too "similar". Only now do I appreciate the true
depth that this humble subject has to offer. This is especially true after
solving many beautifully crafted Olympiad problems.

Of course, now that I have pages filled with diagrams of problems and solutions,
it only worsens my ever-increasing queue of "math to convert to LaTeX".
Diagrams are also more tedious because it requires additional tools like
Asymptote.

Nonetheless, geometry has a new place in my heart. Gone are the days of *just
another find the length problem*. It's a field where more of its magic is
revealed to you the deeper you go. But go too far, and you'll start looking for
concyclic points in stars and raindrops.`(sidenote "This is the famous Tetris
effect. My record is having diagrams appear in my dream. Besides geometry and
Tetris, I've also dreamt of Lisp code.")`

That's pretty much what I've been up to lately. Excuse my bad writing, this is
being written at 4 AM in the morning (revised a day later). ;p
