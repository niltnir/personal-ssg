As you can see, I try to limit the number of places I check. If you decide to
contact me via email, using [encryption](https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/)
is highly recommended to protect your privacy.

## Inactive

Although official, do not send me messages through any accounts listed below. I
will not respond for the simple reason that I do not actively check them.
These accounts are meant more for archive purposes.
