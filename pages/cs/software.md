# Software Projects

I have plans to release the source for most of the projects listed here, but
for now, some of these may be closed for one reason or another.

`(inject '(hr))`

## [nodalynn.com](https://github.com/niltnir/personal-ssg)

This site was built using the [Haunt](https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html)
static site generator. Its simplicity and hackability made it a clear choice
for use.

Adopting Haunt also meant I got to write Scheme code, making the development
experience really nice. In particular, the galleries you find [here](/art) and
the side notes you see [here](/) were generated by declarations made directly
inside markdown files. This is possible because Lisp makes it easy to hack the
html tree (SXML) generated by the markdown reader. Syntactical distinctions
between code and SXML cease to exist, making the workflow very smooth.

Essentially, this is what I do to update the site:

1. If I want to create a new post or make an update on a page,
    - I write markdown for text.
    - I add images to my assets for galleries.
2. If I want to add a new feature,
    - I implement functionality with Scheme (with SXML embedded as a "DSL").
    - I stylize or add interactivity with CSS.

The beauty of this is the sheer lack of templating languages and
Javascript`(sidenote "So far, the only Javascript used on this site is a simple
link to KaTeX through a CDN for rendering math.")` in making an "interactive"
and "modern-looking" static website.

`(inject '(h2 (@ (id "zedigo")) "Zedigo"))`

Zedigo is a web app I worked on with [Sean Zhang](https://www.seanzhang.ca) for
approximately two years between October 2020 and September 2022. The goal was
to build a tool/system enabling individual users to create high-quality
hand-drawn animated videos or films in a reasonable`(sidenote "Can an animation
be made like a recorded film?")` amount of time.

The idea stems from a particular problem we were trying to solve:

> Commercial hand-drawn animation projects (animated ads, TV anime, feature
> films, short films, YouTube videos, video game assets) typically require
> orchestrating tens to hundreds of animators and middle managers from
> potentially multiple different studios. A reason is that hand-drawn
> animation is a time-consuming and complex task requiring hundreds of hours
> spent by single animators for relatively short output. In other words,
> high-quality animation as a medium is a complex art form requiring an
> absurdly high labor threshold, currently out of the reach of many independent
> creators.

Put more concisely and bluntly,

> We, indies, want to make anime!

We decided to take this project in another direction, so it will likely come
back as something different.

`(inject '(hr))`

`(inject '(h2 (@ (id "color-switcher"))
(a (@ (href "https://github.com/niltnir/color-switcher"))
"Color Switcher")))`

*Color Switcher* is my first web project using pure HTML, CSS, and JS.

Here's a [link](https://okimath.com/cs00/color_switcher.html) to a working
version. The text is in Japanese, but hopefully, the interface is intuitive
enough to grok.

The game comes from a simple math olympiad [problem](/math/oly/bamo-19993.html)
I found a long time ago. The idea is to invent an algorithm to make all the
cells in the grid reach the same parity (color in the case of *Color Switcher*,
key direction in the case of the math problem).

The surprising part is how little knowledge is actually required to solve the
problem. Primary students with problem-solving backgrounds have a good chance
of figuring it out.

Because I made the game for a [Japanese content creator](https://okimath.com), there
are corresponding videos for the
[problem](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=UdLtG_SBymA) and
[solution](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=zagKmjLQaw0) in Japanese.

`(inject '(hr))`

## [Autoclip](https://github.com/niltnir/autoclip)

Autoclip is a rusty, old program I wrote and gave away for free.

It is based on the tool
[*jumpcutter*](https://github.com/carykh/jumpcutter) that Cary K. Huang wrote and
demonstrated in one of his YouTube videos. I re-engineered a simple Windows
desktop version in Java`(sidenote "I know I have come far when reading the last
phrase of the sentence makes me cringe a little on the inside.")`.

Demos were made for the tool in Japanese by [Hideki Goya](https://okimath.com).
[Here](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=AIcyNUiSj-4) is the video explaining
installation and usage, and [here](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=XK35WThF9oo) is a
video edited using Autoclip.

Unfortunately, despite the demo above, the project is currently unmaintained,
archived, and dead. A build might still work under newer environments, but if
the API calls to ffmpeg have changed, there's a high chance that it will not
function properly under new versions.

If you decide to take a peek at the source, be warned, because it is probably
way uglier than you think (I was still pretty new to hacking back then).
