# Art & Design

Welcome to my portfolio! I love making art and designing weird things! I hope
you stick around because there is always more to come.

Here are some things I've created over the years:

## Analog Artworks

Drawing has been a part of my life ever since I could remember. I love pencil,
pen, and oil pastel, but I surprisingly never got into painting. I want to
learn oil painting at some point, but more and more of my time has
inadvertently been swept into the digital world.

## Digital Artworks

I started digital painting around the same time I got into drawing 2D
characters. Since then, I've mostly been sketching stuff from my imagination.
The works below are therefore abstract (with some more abstract than others).

In terms of software usage, I wish I could say that I didn't use proprietary
software, but I end up submitting myself to at least one of the following:
Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint, and Medibang Paint. Nowadays, I use Linux almost
exclusively, and sadly, none of these are even installable`(sidenote "Using
Wine feels like a kludge to me.")`. As you can imagine, I am still looking for
clean, open-source solutions. I might play around with Krita, GIMP, and
Inkscape, and maybe even try hacking something up on my own.

## Posters

The posters below were all digitally designed. Among these, *Notice What's
Breaking You* and *Flick* were submitted to poster contests. For fun, I decided
to turn *think* into a T-shirt for me to wear.

`(gallery (slide "creations/posters/ap.jpg" "(2016) Altered Perspective"

          (slide "creations/posters/nwby.jpg"
                 "(2017) Notice What's Breaking You" "Attention is grabbed."
                 '((p "The portability of your phone means you have access to

                   (p "This means it is now possible to bombard your mind with
                   an insensible amount of information. Although it's premature

                   it can affect the way you think and behave (e.g.,
                   compromising sleep for social media).")
                   (p "The work received 2nd place at a local poster

Drawing anime characters has been an obsession of mine ever since I was a
kid, that is until I realized I could design them...

`(gallery (slide "creations/anime/miku.png" "(2018) Hatsune Miku" "One of
my favorite character designs!" "This was probably the first illustration I
made after leaving school.")
          (slide "creations/anime/lod.png" "(2020) Law
of Dogs" "Yubi Yubi..." "This is a piece where I experimented with mixing a
familiar anime style with street art elements and abstract expressionism."))`

`(inject '(hr))`

`(inject '(h2 (@ (id "chardes")) "Character Designs"))`

Why draw iconic characters when you can **design** them? For me, this simple
question turned into an enlightening pursuit. Many people can draw Mickey or
Pikachu, but the genius comes from their designs. They were designed to be
appealing, loveable, and simple to draw. So what's stopping me from designing
my ultimate waifu?

### Sketches

Fun sketches and experiments make way for better ideas.

                 "Basic Gestures" "" "")

                 "Exotic Design Ideas" "" ""))`

### (2021) Lambdus Mascot

Looking back at this design, I find it rough around the edges. In particular,
there are a few improvements that immediately come to mind.

First, the design should decrease the number of shapes used throughout. There
are a lot of small details that make drawing the design a pain. Reducing
information can also cause less eye-strain to the viewer.

Another is simplifying the way parts of the design are colored. The minimal
palette works well for the design, but coloring can occasionally be confusing.
For example, how should the hair be "properly" colored? There should be more
room for flexibility.

Finally, the design should strengthen the character's personality more through
some gestures and emphasis of 3-space. Neglecting this point will often make the
character look lifeless.

                 "")

          (slide "creations/lambdus/chardesigns/mdp2.png"
                 "Blue-Cyan Palette" "" "")

                 "Magenta-Pink Palette" "" "")

                 "Smug" "" ""))`

`(inject '(hr (@ (class "gap"))))`

### (2022) Lambdus

The design here is simpler than the Lambdus mascot, but issues still carry
over. The lack of gestures makes the characters look lifeless. Part of this was
intentional because we were experimenting with modular drawing, but nonetheless,
they look **dead**.

`(gallery (slide "creations/lambdus/chardesigns/mlc.png"
                 "Minimal Lambdus Characters" "Minimum Viable? Product" "")
          (slide "creations/lambdus/chardesigns/glc.png"
                 "Graphic Lambdus Characters" "Fun clay-like design" ""))`

`(inject '(hr (@ (class "gap"))))`

Admittedly, looking at it now, my first few attempts are weak. But back when I
was doing the actual designing, they seemed to me well-designed. The neat thing
is that experience gives you sharper tastes over time.

Sometimes the way to improve is to design so much that you begin intuitively
sensing weak design decisions.

As soon as I can start making more short films (animated or not), the more
storyboards there will be :-)

`(inject '(hr (@ (class "gap"))))`

### (2021) The Door
This is an abandoned [Lambdus](/misc/lambdus.html) project. Nonetheless, here is my
noobie attempt at storyboarding:

`(inject '(hr))`

`(inject '(h2 (@ (id "animation")) "Film & Animation"))`

Independently being able to produce hand-drawn animated films is the holy grail
of [Zedigo](/cs/software.html#zedigo). It is currently far from complete, but
progress is ongoing.

At some point, I want to come up with a scene or a storyboard and immediately
be able to render something to video.

In the meantime, check out some shorts I made:

`(gallery (slide "https://yewtu.be/embed/UbmIlrCGiMQ?autoplay=0&autostart=0"
                 "(2022) test.mp4"
                 "My first real attempt at character animation"
                 "")
          (slide "https://yewtu.be/embed/ioiQ6UllyK8?autoplay=0&autostart=0"
                 "(2022) Jumping on an Elevator"
                 "What if you jump?"
                 "This short was made in collaboration with Sean Zhang. I voiced
                 the characters and animated the facial expressions, the
                 loops, and the end scene."))`

`(inject '(h2 (@ (id "logos")) "Logo Designs"))`

A logo is perhaps one of the hardest things to design. It needs to convey the
ethos of a product, company, brand, etc., in a single impression. The key is to
compose shapes and visuals that communicate clearly.

                 "Lambda Calculus FTW!" "")

### (2021) Washoku Design Process

decided not to operate, so here are its remains.

                 design around.")
          (slide "creations/washoku/washoku1.png" "Initial Design" ""
                 "The placement of the chopsticks now emphasizes the idea of

                 "The sketchy style made it hard to distinguish the type of
                 flower at first sight. By redesigning the flower to be simple

                 '((p "The brush stroke around the image was a way to

                   (p "The image of the cherry blossom felt sufficient
                   in conveying the notion of 'Japan', so the stroke was redundant.")
