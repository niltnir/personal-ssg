# Math

Here is where I get to nerd out about, say, Ramsey theory.

I will link articles, notes, and other shenanigans about math. A lot of the
math I do is written down somewhere on paper, so unfortunately, it will take a
while to transcribe to a digital format.

Other places where you may see math from time to time are either in my
[blog](/prose/blog) or in my [essays](/prose/essay).

I wrote some articles about topics that interested me.

- [(2020) Existence of Primitive Roots Modulo Primes via Cyclotomic Polynomials](/assets/pdf/math/primitiveroots.pdf)
- [(2020) Solving First-Order Non-Homogeneous Linear Recurrence Relations](/assets/pdf/math/recurrencelinear.pdf)

A Japanese handout I wrote to tutor my cousin:

## Olympiad Solutions

Sorry! Nothing here yet :-(

Eventually, I'll set up the technical infrastructure to have LaTeX integrated
with my site build. In the meantime, feel free to check out the PDF articles
listed above instead!

## Video Translations

Something I used to do for fun was translate Japanese math videos into
English. These are all the videos listed by channel:
