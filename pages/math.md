# Math

Here is where I get to nerd out about, say, Ramsey theory.

I will link articles, notes, and other shenanigans about math. A lot of the
math I do is written down somewhere on paper, so unfortunately, it will take a
while to transcribe to a digital format.

Other places where you may see math from time to time are either in my
[blog](/prose/blog) or in my [essays](/prose/essay).

I wrote some articles about topics that interested me.

- [(2020) Existence of Primitive Roots Modulo Primes via Cyclotomic Polynomials](/assets/pdf/math/primitiveroots.pdf)
- [(2020) Solving First-Order Non-Homogeneous Linear Recurrence Relations](/assets/pdf/math/recurrencelinear.pdf)

A Japanese handout I wrote to tutor my cousin:

`(inject '(h2 (@ (id "olympiad"))
(a (@ (href "/math/oly")) "Olympiad Solutions")))`

Problems and solutions can be found by following the link above. If you want to
work on a problem first, I suggest you stay on the problem index until you are
sure you want to look at the solution. A brief discussion of the motivation for
the solution usually follows the solution itself. Any concerns about notation
should be dealt with [here](math/oly-notation.html).

Problems are typically taken from national Olympiads which can be readily
accessed via the
[AoPS Contest Collections](https://aops.com/community/c13_contest_collections).
Otherwise, the problems I post will be taken from problems I happen to know
from the culture. These are labeled as "Folklore", as the exact sources are
either not known or hard to track (for example, a problem may appear in
multiple places by different authors from varying periods).

The solutions are primarily of my own insight, but are likely to be similar to
official solutions if they exist. If any mathematical errors are found
(especially significant ones), please contact
me via [email](mailto:lynn@nodalynn.com); I want to have
[Cunningham's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham#Law)
work for me as much as possible`(sidenote "I will likely also post the
solutions on AoPS when I get the chance.")`. Luckily, the topic in discussion
is mathematics, so misinformation is less significant and is *a priori*
correctable. Nonetheless, I have tried my best to verify the correctness of my
solutions by contemplating solutions written by others.

In a similar vein, my solutions will likely not be the cleanest in the world.
Therefore, I recommend approaching them with a grain of salt. Healthy
skepticism is encouraged so that you not only notice potentially *incorrect*
reasoning (as in the case above), but are able to come up with more clever
ideas.

As a final disclaimer, I **do not own** any of the problems posted on the list
unless otherwise specified. This means that copyright holders such as
the [MAA](https://maa.org/) and the [CMS](https://cms.math.ca/) have full
rights to their respective problems. The problems are posted in the hopes that
my solutions and their commentary will be useful to students (myself included)
and educators in mathematics under fair-use/dealing. I do **not** gain
monetarily from using the problems in any manner whatsoever.

I have gained a lot from the free resources provided by the culture, and
hopefully, my limited insights are something I can give back.

## Video Translations

Something I used to do for fun was translate Japanese math videos into
English. These are all the videos listed by channel:

**Masaki Koga:**
- [What Research Fields Are There in Math? I Drew Out a Map of Mathematics!](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=fK_JGVti5y8)

**Shikihenkei Channel (Hideki Goya):**
- [Uniform Convergence Quiz](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=GiyGHjFV5DM)
- [Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=eOTulYHIrp4)
- [Math in English](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=NPCOS8OWh4M)`(sidenote
  "This isn't a translation, but me explaining English math terms to
  Goya-san.")`
